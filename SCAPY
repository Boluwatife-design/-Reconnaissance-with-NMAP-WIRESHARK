sudo su : Switches to the root user, which is required because Scapy needs elevated privileges to capture packets and interact with network interfaces.

scapy : Launches the Scapy interactive shell.

sniff() : Starts capturing packets on the default network interface until manually stopped.

ping google.com : This creates ICMP packets (echo-request and echo-reply), allowing Scapy to capture live traffic.

In ping terminal → Ctrl + C : Stops the ping.

temi = _
         : _ in Scapy (and Python REPL) represents the last output.
          This stores the sniffed packets inside variable temi.

temi.summary(): Displays a shorthand list of every packet captured (e.g., ARP, ICMP, TCP, DNS).

sniff(iface="br-internal") : Starts sniffing specifically on the interface br-internal, which is likely the internal NAT or lab network.

ping 10.6.6.1/24 : Pinging a gateway or device pushes new packets through the network — ARP requests, ARP replies, ICMP traffic.

Open browser → type 10.6.6.23
              TCP handshake packets
              HTTP GET request(s)
              DNS lookups (if hostname used)
              Responses from the server

sniff(iface="br-internal", filter="icmp", count=5):
            This tells Scapy:
            Listen only on br-internal
            Capture only ICMP packets
            Stop after 5 packets

temi3[3] : Shows the 4th packet captured in full detail.
           An ICMP request
           An ICMP reply
           ARP resolution packet (if ARP occurred before ICMP)
This prints the whole packet structure (IP layer → ICMP layer → payload).
