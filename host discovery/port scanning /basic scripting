nmap -v : To check nmap version

nmap -sn 10.6.6.0/24 : Performs a ping scan (no port scanning) across the subnet 10.6.6.0/24 to identify which hosts are up and reachable.

sudo nmap -O 10.6.6.23 : Attempts to identify the operating system running on the target host (10.6.6.23).
                         This helps understand the environment and potential OS-specific vulnerabilities.

nmap -p21 -sV -A -T4 10.6.6.23 : Scans port 21 specifically with:
                                -sV → Detects service versions
                                -A → Enables OS detection, traceroute, and NSE scripts
                                -T4 → Faster scan timing

nmap -p139,445 -A 10.6.6.23 : Scans Windows SMB ports (139 and 445) with aggressive detection.
                              Useful to identify:SMB version
                              Security posture
                              Potential SMB vulnerabilities

nmap --script smb-enum-shares.nse -p445 10.6.6.23: Runs the SMB share enumeration script against port 445.
                                                   Reveals: Shared folders, Permissions & Anonymous access possibilities

smbclient //10.6.6.23/print$ -N: Attempts to access the SMB share print$ without authentication (-N).
                                 If access succeeds, you can browse files within the share.

ifconfig: Displays network interface configuration:
          IP address, MAC address &Network status

ip route: Shows the system’s routing table, including:
          Default gateway, Routing paths & Interface assignment
          Useful for understanding how traffic leaves the machine

cat /etc/resolv.conf : Displays DNS server configuration.
                        Helps verify: Domain names & DNS servers being used

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -w flames.pcap: Captures all network traffic on interface eth0, saving it to a file named ladies.pcap.
                                          Parameters: -i eth0 → specify interface
                                                      -s 0 → capture full packets (no truncation)
